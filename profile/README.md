#  BeanChain

**BeanChain** is a modular, transparent blockchain ecosystem built for speed, flexibility, and developer empowerment. With a layered architecture and fully extensible transaction system, BeanChain supports on-chain and off-chain logic, multi-language contract execution, and fully customizable node roles.

Weâ€™re deep in development and actively expanding our team. The BeanChain devnet is evolving fast â€” and weâ€™re almost ready to open the doors to a broader community.

## Core Technologies

- **Layered Node Architecture** â€” GPN (Genesis Public Node), PN (Public Node), RN (Reward Node), CEN (Contract Execution Node), and more  
- **Custom TX Types & Flags** â€” Transfer, Reward, Airdrop, Mint, Contract Call, and more  
- **Off-Chain Smart Contract Execution** â€” via `CENCALL` and `fundedCENCALL`  
- **Layer 2 Token Minting and Transfers**  
- **Peripheral Node Support** â€” build your own node modules that connect, listen, and react to chain data  
- **Multi-Language Contract Goals** â€” upcoming support for contracts written in Java, Go, Python and more  
- **Shared Core Module** â€” `bean-pack-java` powers consistent transaction and contract logic across all nodes

## What's Coming

- **Discord Community Launch** â€” soon opening our server for devs, builders, and curious minds  
- **Historical Node Framework** â€” SQL-accessible chain history for explorers and dApps  
- **GhostNet Testnet** â€” a themed fork of the chain for creative public testing  
- **Lightweight Node Kits** â€” portable P2P node skeletons
