# BeanChain

**BeanChain** is a modular, transparent blockchain ecosystem built for speed, flexibility, and developer empowerment. Designed with a layered architecture, extensible transaction system, and a strong focus on customizability, BeanChain supports both on-chain and off-chain logic, multi-language contract execution, and permissionless node development.

> Currently in devnet phase â€” powered by a growing set of core tools, core nodes, and custom SDKs maintained by the **BeanChain Core Team** under **Outlandish Tech**, a division of **Outlandish Creative LLC**.

## Core Architecture

At the heart of BeanChain is a flexible, layered node system that allows the network to scale horizontally and vertically:

- **GPN â€“ Genesis Public Node**  
  The first public node on the chain. Acts as the anchor for synchronization and transaction gossip.

- **PN â€“ Public Node**  
  Public-facing node for wallet access and transaction relay. Maintains Spring Boot APIs for integration.

- **RN â€“ Reward Node**  
  Handles system-level transaction generation: faucet payouts, validator gas rewards, early wallet distributions. Also tracks validator trust scores via ping/pong logic.

- **CEN â€“ Contract Execution Node**  
  Executes off-chain smart contract logic and initiates contract-based Layer 1 or Layer 2 transactions.

- **Historical Node** *(Coming Soon)*  
  A SQL-powered node that stores block history and exposes high-performance, load-balanced endpoints for explorers and DApps.

> Peripheral nodes like the CEN and Historical Node will be released in **barebones, customizable form**, allowing developers to build and extend node logic freely while connected to the network.

## Technology Highlights

- **Custom Transaction Types & Flags**  
  Built-in support for `transfer`, `reward`, `airdrop`, `mint`, `contractCall`, `fundedCENCALL`, and more.

- **Off-Chain Contract Execution**  
  Via CENs, enabling lightweight contract logic without bloating consensus layers.

- **Layer 2 Token Framework**  
  Full minting, burning, and transferring support for fungible tokens, stored and indexed in the Layer2DB.

- **Peripheral Node Flexibility**  
  Build custom nodes that connect to the network and trigger logic â€” including oracles, APIs, automation, and more.

- **Multi-Language Contract Support** *(in progress)*  
  Java support is live. Go, Python, and JS support are in planning to open the CEN to any developer language.

- **Shared Core SDK**  
  [`BeanPack-Java`](https://github.com/BeanChain-Core/BeanPack-Java) â€” the official Java SDK providing transaction logic, hashing, Merkle tree utilities, and model definitions for Java-based tools and nodes.
