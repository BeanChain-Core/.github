# BeanChain

**BeanChain** is a modular, transparent blockchain ecosystem built for speed, flexibility, and developer empowerment. With a layered architecture, extensible transaction system, and a strong focus on permissionless node development, BeanChain supports both on-chain and off-chain logic, multi-language contract execution, and open tooling for infrastructure builders.

> Currently in devnet phase â€” powered by a growing set of core tools, node frameworks, and SDKs maintained by the **BeanChain Core Team** under **Outlandish Tech**, a division of **Outlandish Creative LLC**.

## Core Architecture

At the heart of BeanChain is a flexible, layered node system designed to scale horizontally and vertically:

- **GPN â€“ Genesis Public Node**  
  The first public node on the chain. Acts as the bootstrap anchor for synchronization and transaction gossip.

- **PN â€“ Public Node**  
  Public-facing node for wallets and dApps. Maintains REST endpoints for sending and syncing transactions.

- **RN â€“ Reward Node**  
  Handles system-level transaction generation, including faucet payouts, validator rewards, and early wallet distributions. Also tracks validator trust scores through ping/pong logic.

- **CEN â€“ Contract Execution Node** *(in development)*  
  Executes off-chain smart contract logic and triggers Layer 1 or Layer 2 transactions. Contracts like staking will launch here first.

- **Historical Node** *(in development)*  
  A SQL-powered node that archives blocks and exposes high-throughput, load-balanced endpoints for explorers and external apps.

> Peripheral nodes like the CEN and Historical Node will be released in **barebones, customizable form**, allowing developers to plug in their own contract logic, data services, or analytics layers using real-time sync from open Public Nodes.

## Technology Highlights

- **Custom Transaction Types & Flags**  
  Built-in support for `transfer`, `reward`, `airdrop`, `mint`, `contractCall`, `fundedCENCALL`, and more.

- **Off-Chain Contract Execution**  
  Through CENs, enabling scalable contract logic without bloating consensus layers.

- **Layer 2 Token Framework**  
  Mint, burn, and transfer custom tokens. All tokens are tracked in the Layer2DB, separate from the core state tree.

- **Peripheral Node Flexibility**  
  Build your own nodes that connect to the network and trigger custom logic â€” including oracles, event-driven bots, and data relays.

- **Multi-Language Contract Support** *(in progress)*  
  Java support is live. Go, Python, and JavaScript support is planned for broader accessibility via the CEN.

- **Shared Core SDK**  
  [`BeanPack-Java`](https://github.com/BeanChain-Core/BeanPack-Java) â€” the official SDK used across all Java-based nodes, containing shared models, crypto tools, and core transaction logic.
